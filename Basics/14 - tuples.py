# tuple declaration with brackets, (list declaration with square brackets)
# tuples are unchangable(immutable) => once declared cannot be changed again
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
numbers.count()  # returns the number of elements(such as len() at a list), tuples don't have functions like .append() or .insert() because they are NOT changable
